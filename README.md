# Brick Breaker

A MATLAB game that plays an original version of the game, Brick Breaker, on a GUI.

Note: The iterations are saved in separate files rather than separate commits; this is of course inefficient and against standard practice - this was my second project ever and it was before I knew about GitHub.

# Installation and Usage

1. Download the repository.
2. Open the root folder in MATLAB.
3. Choose a "game_bricks_vX.m" file and execute it (where X is the version number, 1-23). The MATLAB GUI window will popup and you can play the game.
